Software which allows you to control a car on Windows
  
You need to install Gtk+ on your own. For that go on https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows/  
install gtk3 and gtk4. If you want you can add build tools but you don't need them to run the program  

then change your environment variables by adding a new path which points to your gtk bin (C:\msys64\mingw64\bin for instance but it can be in any other disk)
  
After doing all of that you can use the source code !
